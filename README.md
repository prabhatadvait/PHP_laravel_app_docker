Running PHP Application in docker
Welcome to my PHP Laravel Basic Web App repository! This project demonstrates a fundamental Laravel application deployed inside a Docker container, highlighting my proficiency in Docker and Linux environments. By containerizing the Laravel application, I ensure seamless deployment, portability, and scalability across different systems.
Project Overview:

This web application is built using PHP Laravel, one of the most popular PHP frameworks, known for its elegant syntax and powerful features. Docker containers encapsulate the application and its dependencies, providing a consistent development and production environment.
